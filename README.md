# parallel-nanoalloys
Parallel algorithms for studying the thermal stability of nanoalloys. A repository for all the code used in the TW3725TU Final Project of the Computational Science and Engineering Minor 

# Usage
There are two versions of the program. The serial and parallel. Directory serial_version includes all the python files which run sequentially. It is a good starting point for any new contributions regarding parallelization. Directory parallel_version includes combination of files - some can be run in parallel and others not. This is in detail described in section below - structure of the code. Both directories include all the necessary files for running the whole program framework: from nanoalloy initialization to reading of melting temperature from graph.

NOTE: to run the parallel version on DelftBlue supercomputer, it suffices to submit a job as described in DelftBlue_user_guide.txt . This file contains all the necessary steps, such as library downloads, path exports and DelftBlue supercomputer specifications, such as number of cores to be used. 

# structure of the code
<filename.py> - <must be run sequentially/parallel, or is supporting file (not to be executed on its own)>, <description of the functionality>

collapse.py - sequential, "collapses" all the csv log files generated by different replicas into one csv file - to be read by parallel_wham.py 
              for statistical data analysis
coreshell.py - supporting, helps initialize coreshell nanoalloy
initialize_nanoalloy.py - supporting, allows to initialize nanoalloy based on inputs.txt file
inputs.txt - supporting, contains all the user specifications regarding the research, such as element type, what type of nanoalloy, ...
parallel_wham.py - parallel/supporting, contains parallel implementation of the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method
py_bigfloat.py - supporting, wrapper class for python's BigFloat library, so that it functions like numpy fashion
replica_exchange_parallel.py - parallel/supporting, contains parallel implementation of Replica Exchange algorithm
run_replica.py - parallel, reads nanoalloy initialization inputs from inputs.txt and calls to execute replica_exchange_parallel.py
sbatch_script.sh - script to be submitted to scheduler on DelftBlue supercomputer, user can modify number of cores, runtime, ...

## Installation
To run the complete version of the whole program (serial or parallel version), it is only necessary to download all the files from the corresponding directory: serial_version or parallel_version. Then run the files in the order specified by the sbatch_script.sh
