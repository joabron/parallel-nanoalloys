## parallel-nanoalloys
Parallel molecular dynamics simulation algorithm for studying thermal stability of nanoalloys. A repository for all the code used in the TW3725TU Final Project of the Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Minor. This code implements a combination of various sub-components for the investigation of the thermal stability of nanoalloys. The code consists of the nanoalloy initialization, followed by molecular dynamics runs in a Replica Exchange (RE) framework, followed by the Weigthed Histogram Analysis Method, a statistical analysis tool for generating the graph of heat capcity vs temperature from the temperature and potential energy data output from RE.

##Abstract
Bimetallic nanoalloys are nano-scale clusters of atoms
that can greatly vary in composition and shape. They
have shown promising results in catalysis, biomedical
and optical applications. Exploration of their thermody-
namic stability through physical experiments is both dif-
ficult and expensive, thus justifying the need for molec-
ular dynamics (MD) simulations to quicken the pro-
cess of finding the most stable structures with specified
properties of interest. In this report, a novel stream-
lined Replica Exchange and Weighted Histogram Analy-
sis Method software was developed as a tool for studying
thermal stability of custom configurations and compo-
sitions of bimetallic nanoalloys. The software is paral-
lelized and tested on the DelftBlue supercomputer, for
which the run-times were analyzed and demonstrate a
sub-linear speedup.

## Usage
There are two versions of the program: the serial and parallel. Directory serial_version includes all the python files which run sequentially. It is a good starting point for any new contributions regarding parallelization. Directory parallel_version includes combination of files - some can be run in parallel and others not. This is in detail described in section below - structure of the code. Both directories include all the necessary files for running the whole program framework: from nanoalloy initialization to reading of melting temperature from graph.

NOTE: to run the parallel version on DelftBlue supercomputer, it suffices to submit a job as described in DelftBlue_user_guide.txt . This file contains all the necessary steps, such as library downloads, path exports and DelftBlue supercomputer specifications, such as number of cores to be used. 

## structure of the code
`filename.py` - <must be run sequentially/parallel, or is supporting file (not to be executed on its own)><description of the functionality>
  
  `collapse.py` - sequential, "collapses" all the csv log files generated by different replicas into one csv file - to be read by parallel_wham.py for statistical data analysis`coreshell.py` - supporting, helps initialize coreshell nanoalloy.
  
  `initialize_nanoalloy.py` - supporting, allows to initialize nanoalloy based on inputs.txt file
  
  `inputs.txt` - supporting, contains all the user specifications regarding the research, such as element type, what type of nanoalloy, ...
  
  `parallel_wham.py` - parallel/supporting, contains parallel implementation of the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method
  
  `py_bigfloat.py` - supporting, wrapper class for python's BigFloat library, so that it functions like numpy fashion
  
  `replica_exchange_parallel.py` - parallel/supporting, contains parallel implementation of Replica Exchange algorithm
  
`run_replica.py` - parallel, reads nanoalloy initialization inputs from inputs.txt and calls to execute replica_exchange_parallel.py
  
`sbatch_script.sh` - script to be submitted to scheduler on DelftBlue supercomputer, user can modify number of cores, runtime, ...

## Installation
To run the complete version of the whole program (serial or parallel version), it is only necessary to download all the files from the corresponding directory: serial_version or parallel_version. Then run the files in the order specified by the sbatch_script.sh
